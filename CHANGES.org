** TODO Show results for a single student or subgroup of students
TableWriter now has the option to do this. The runner has
to be updated in order to support appropriate command line arguments.

Moreover, it would be very nice to be able to print students in a certain
group, or student whose grade for a certain evaluation is greater than or
smaller than some value.

** TODO Calculate standard deviation
** TODO Calculate mean in percentage
** TODO Change /the headings/ to something that prints nicely in org-mode
For instance, instead of using -- Cumul --, it could be something like *Cumul*
or /Cumul/. Also the header names should be easily changed. Probably the best
way to do this is to define a new property for GradesTable.
** TODO Improved the object-orientedness by using properties 
** TODO Make columns easier to manage
They could either objects or dictionaries with some easily usable keys.
